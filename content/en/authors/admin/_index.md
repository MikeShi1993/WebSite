Linyuan received his B.S. in Powder Material Science and Engineering from Central South University in Changsha, China in 2016. He then went to University of Florida first as a master student, and later he joined Dr. Phillpotâ€™s research group and began working on computational material science. His research interests involve using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanical properties of ZrH<sub>2</sub> system and the microstructure and thermomechanical properties of ablative heat shields.
